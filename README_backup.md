- Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana)

## Usage Examples

### Secure API Calls

```python
from blrcs import SecureClient

# Initialize with automatic security
client = SecureClient()

# All operations are automatically secured
response = client.api.get('/sensitive/data')
# Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
# Access is logged and monitored
# Threats are automatically blocked
```

### Protect Sensitive Data

```python
from blrcs import DataProtector

# Automatic classification and protection
protector = DataProtector()

# Store sensitive data
protector.store(
    data="SSN: 123-45-6789",
    classification="PII",
    retention_days=2555
)
# Automatically encrypted with appropriate algorithm
# Access control applied based on classification
# Audit trail maintained
```

### Monitor Security Events

```python
from blrcs import SecurityMonitor

# Real-time security monitoring
monitor = SecurityMonitor()

# Set up alerts
monitor.alert_on(
    events=['failed_login', 'data_exfiltration'],
    severity='critical',
    notify=['security-team@localhost']
)

# Get security insights
insights = monitor.get_insights()
print(f"Threats blocked today: {insights.threats_blocked}")
print(f"Security score: {insights.security_score}/100")
```
